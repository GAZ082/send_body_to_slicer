# Intro
This macro for FreeCAD allows you to send a selected body to the slicer of your preference. Refer to the CONFIG section in the script.
Make sure to add the macro to the Toolbar for convenience.

# How To Use
1. Select a body.
2. Run the macro.
3. Your Slicer should open after a few seconds (depending on how complex the model is) with the body loaded.

Thanks!
